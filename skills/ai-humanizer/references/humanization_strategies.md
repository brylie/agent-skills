# Humanization Strategies

Transform AI-generated text into "High-Value Narrative" while strictly preserving technical reasoning and core meaning.

## Core Transformation Principles

### Preserve vs. Transform

**PRESERVE:**

- Technical reasoning
- Core facts and arguments
- Logical structure
- Substantive content

**TRANSFORM:**

- Stylistic uniformity
- Predictable vocabulary
- Mechanical rhythm
- Bureaucratic tone
- Superficial analysis

## Active Commands for Humanization

### 1. De-Nominalize the Prose

**Goal:** Restore narrative momentum by converting abstract noun phrases back to active verbs.

**Pattern to find:**

- "the implementation of"
- "the provision of"
- "the utilization of"
- "the acceleration of"

**Transform to:**

- "implemented"
- "provided"
- "used"
- "accelerated"

**Example:**

- AI: "The utilization of this methodology led to an acceleration in the provision of services."
- Human: "Using this method helped us provide services faster."

### 2. Punctuation Injection

**Goal:** Break "metronomic" rhythm by diversifying punctuation.

**Actions:**

- Replace periods with semicolons to connect related ideas
- Incorporate dashes for emphasis or dramatic pauses
- Add parenthetical asides to mimic human thought patterns
- Use colons sparingly and purposefully

**Example:**

- AI: The process was completed. It was successful.
- Human: The process—long considered a bottleneck—is finally complete; it exceeded all expectations.

### 3. Truncate Overthinking Loops

**Goal:** Eliminate redundant content after Reasoning Completion Point (RCP).

**Actions:**

- Identify where the answer is clearly stated
- Delete redundant rationalizations that follow
- Remove "looping" thoughts that offer no new information
- Cut paragraphs that re-explain what was already clear

**Signs of overthinking:**

- Repetitive explanations
- Circular reasoning
- Hedging after conclusion reached
- "In other words" followed by same content

### 4. Inject Idiomatic Variance

**Goal:** Replace generic phrases with natural human expressions.

**Pattern to find:**

- "This task is very easy to finish"
- "The team worked hard to improve"
- "This is important to understand"

**Transform to:**

- "This task is a total cakewalk"
- "The team gutted the interface to fix friction points"
- "This matters because..."

**Sources of idiomatic language:**

- Domain-specific jargon
- Natural metaphors
- Cultural expressions
- Visceral, low-frequency words

### 5. Personalize References

**Goal:** Warm up impersonal tone and add human agency.

**Actions:**

- Reduce determiners and adpositions
- Add personal references where appropriate
- Use active voice over passive
- Identify clear actors/subjects

**Example:**

- AI: "The utilization of the system resulted in improvements."
- Human: "We used the system and saw improvements."

### 6. Vary Sentence Structure

**Goal:** Increase burstiness by mixing sentence lengths and complexity.

**Actions:**

- Follow long, complex sentence with short, punchy one
- Alternate between simple and compound structures
- Break up uniform rhythm
- Create "bumpy" complexity pattern

**Example:**

- AI: "The system was designed to optimize performance. The system achieved its goals. The system was effective."
- Human: "The system was designed to optimize performance, and it worked. Really worked."

### 7. Replace Overused Vocabulary

**Goal:** Eliminate marker words that signal AI authorship.

**Priority replacements:**

- "delve" → explore, examine, look at, dig into
- "leverage" → use, apply, take advantage of
- "robust" → strong, reliable, solid
- "nuanced" → complex, subtle, detailed
- "tapestry" → mix, combination, blend
- "landscape" → field, area, space
- "underscore" → highlight, emphasize, show

**For hedging terms:**

- Remove unnecessary "arguably," "potentially," "essentially"
- Replace with direct statements or genuine uncertainty
- Use hedging only when truly warranted

### 8. Eliminate Superficial Analysis

**Goal:** Add genuine insight or remove empty elaboration.

**Actions:**

- Cut "-ing" phrases that add no meaning ("further enhancing its significance")
- Replace colon-list elisions with actual explanations
- Remove authoritative puffery without evidence
- Convert vague attributions to specific citations or remove them
- Add purpose and context to explanations

**Example:**

- AI: "The city's proximity to the capital further enhances its significance as a dynamic hub."
- Human: "Being close to the capital makes it economically important." OR simply remove the phrase

### 9. Fix Tense and Voice Inconsistencies

**Goal:** Create stable, natural narrative flow.

**Actions:**

- Choose consistent tense and stick to it
- Avoid "rapid present tense recovery" tricks
- Use past tense for completed actions
- Use present for ongoing truths
- Ensure voice matches context (formal vs. casual)

### 10. Simplify Correlative Constructions

**Goal:** Break repetitive logical frameworks.

**Patterns to simplify:**

- "not only... but also" → rewrite as two sentences or simplify
- "either... or" → consider if choice is necessary
- "neither... nor" → use more direct phrasing
- "whether... or" → often can be simplified

## Workflow for Humanization

### Step 1: Initial Assessment

Read through once, noting:

- Most egregious AI tells
- Overused vocabulary count
- Rhythm and pacing issues
- Areas of superficial analysis

### Step 2: Structural Fixes

- Truncate overthinking loops
- Eliminate repetitive content
- Remove superficial elaborations
- Fix tense/voice issues

### Step 3: Sentence-Level Transformations

- De-nominalize heavy phrases
- Vary sentence length and structure
- Inject punctuation diversity
- Replace overused vocabulary

### Step 4: Add Human Touch

- Inject idiomatic expressions
- Personalize where appropriate
- Add unexpected word choices
- Include visceral, low-frequency language

### Step 5: Final Polish

- Read aloud to check rhythm
- Ensure preservation of core meaning
- Verify factual accuracy maintained
- Check for remaining AI tells

## Quality Checklist

After humanization, text should have:

- ✓ Varied sentence lengths (high burstiness)
- ✓ Unpredictable vocabulary (high perplexity)
- ✓ Diverse punctuation (not just periods and commas)
- ✓ Active voice and clear subjects
- ✓ Idiomatic expressions and natural phrasing
- ✓ No overused AI vocabulary
- ✓ No nominalized verb phrases
- ✓ No superficial "-ing" elaborations
- ✓ No overthinking loops or circular reasoning
- ✓ Clear purpose and genuine insight (not just explanation)
