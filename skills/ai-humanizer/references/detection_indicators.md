# AI Detection Indicators

## Lexical Indicators: Vocabulary and Phrasing "Tells"

### Lower Lexical Diversity and Token Selection
LLMs favor predictable, high-probability tokens. Human writers use visceral, low-frequency language to create impact.

**Examples:**
- AI: "The team worked hard to improve the product for the users."
- Human: "The team gutted the interface to fix the friction points users were screaming about."

### Punctuation Patterns
AIGT is characterized by high frequency of single quotes and periods, but significant absence of commas, dashes, and semicolons.

**Examples:**
- AI: The 'process' was completed. It was successful.
- Human: The process—long considered a bottleneck—is finally complete; it exceeded all expectations.

### Absence of Idioms
AIGT lacks natural, idiomatic expressions and metaphors. It is overly literal, missing cultural nuances.

**Examples:**
- AI: "This task is very easy to finish."
- Human: "This task is a total cakewalk."

### Repetitive Oscillations and Emoticons
Models fall into "semantic convergence," repeating phrases or using standardized emoticons (🚀, ✨) in predictable patterns.

### "Nonsense Vocabulary" Risk
Vigilance against "hallucinated" technical terminology is critical, particularly in specialized domains where models generate non-existent names, diseases, or technical terms.

## Grammatical & Syntactic Fingerprints

### The Formal/Impersonal Bias
AI over-relies on specific parts of speech that create a "cold" and bureaucratic tone.

**Key Patterns:**

| Feature              | AIGT Tendency                                                                   | Impact                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Parts of Speech      | Increased Nouns, Determiners, Adpositions; lower Adjectives and Adverbs         | Creates "heavy," information-dense text lacking nuance |
| Nominalization       | Converts verbs/adjectives to noun phrases                                       | Makes prose static and bureaucratic                    |
| Syntactic Complexity | Higher dependency distances                                                     | Grammatically correct but taxes working memory         |
| Punctuation          | Dominance of commas/periods; absence of dashes, parentheses, semicolons, colons | Rhythmic monotony                                      |

### Nominalization Examples
**AI:** "The utilization of this methodology led to an acceleration in the provision of services."
**Human:** "Using this method helped us provide services faster."

## Sentence Architecture Patterns

### Low Burstiness and Uniform Rhythm
Sentences cluster around narrow band of length and complexity, lacking alternation between short and long structures.

### Subject Concentration
Complex ideas packaged into simple declarative frames: "The logic is: X" or "The result is: Y"

### The "Subject+Verb+Object, Present Participle" Formula
Attaching "-ing" phrases to sentence ends for elaboration: "The system optimizes the workflow, reducing the time required..."

### Avoidance of Basic Copulatives
Substituting simple verbs (is/are) with formal constructions: "serves as," "stands as," "marks," "represents"

### Formulaic Scaffolding
Symmetric section lengths, rhetorical Q&A structures, bulleted lists separated by colons

## Morphological Markers

### Nominal Loading
Noun-heavy, verb-light prose compressing actions into abstract noun phrases

### Repetitive Correlative Conjunctions
Heavy reliance on: "whether – or," "either – or," "neither – nor"

### Negative Parallelisms
"not only... but also," "it's not about X, it's about Y"

### "From... To..." Prepositional Sequences
Creating "false ranges" where endpoints are loosely related

### The "Rule of Three"
Grouping adjectives or phrases into sets of three for false comprehensiveness

## Tense, Voice, and Punctuation

### Tense Instability
Opening in pluperfect, shifting to present, using "rapid present tense recovery"

### Em Dash Overuse
Over-applied mid-sentence to simulate dramatic pauses (—) where comma or parenthesis would be natural

### Mechanical Punctuation Habit
Heavy reliance on periods/commas while avoiding expressive marks; excessive colons in titles/lists

### Hypercorrection
Producing errors like "grinded" instead of "ground"; jarring shifts between impersonal academic and forced casual registers

### Character and Quote Quirks
Defaulting to curly quotation marks ("...") and apostrophes (') inconsistently
